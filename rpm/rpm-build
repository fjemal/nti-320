# If you don't want to use redhat-release rpm package you can create directory hierarchy manually, use the following steps.
mkdir rpmbuild
mkdir rpmbuild/SOURCES
mkdir rpmbuild/SPECS

#Create a directory with some sample files or scripts that you like to build in the package:
mkdir check_plugin-0.1
cd check_plugin-0.1
#create simple file in shell
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello NTI-320, this is a demo package to test the rpm-building practical"
cd
#Create an archive file based on your sample source:
tar -czvf check_plugin-0.1.tar.gz check_plugin-0.1/
#Now copy this source to /home/fadliebra2012/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
cp check_plugin-0.1.tar.gz /home/fadliebra2012/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
#create spec file
